# All Experimental Results

This folder contains all experimental results for the paper.

- `RQ/`: Results analyzing how IDI diversity affects fairness improvement and accuracy degradation.
- `RQ1/`: Results validating whether DDDGen successfully generates discriminatory datasets with varying diversity levels.
- `RQ2/`: Results comparing the diversity of discriminatory data detected by different fairness testing algorithms (RSUTT, AFT, THEMIS).
- `RQ3/`: Results comparing different retraining methods.


In the section answering for RQ in the paper, only four selected tasks are shown.  
You can find the full results for all 18 tasks in `Results_of_RQ_for_all_tasks.pdf`.
